The libary i used are:

-Async TCP Library for ESP32 Arduino (https://github.com/dvarrel/AsyncTCP)

-ESPAsyncWebServer (https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer)

-FastLED with a bit of change i made to stop the annoying message and now it can only run with ESP32 (https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)
